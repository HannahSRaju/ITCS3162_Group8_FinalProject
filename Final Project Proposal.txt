Introduction
The data set we are looking at is about the credit card purchased which will allow us to get a more in depth understanding of how users spending habits and payment plans. We want to create clusters of users with similar spending habits and how frequently they will pay it off . 
Data
The data we are using is called Credit Card Dataset for Clustering by Arjun Bhasin.

Methodology Plan
We plan on using clustering to try and identify patterns of behavior in credit card usage. We plan on trying at least two forms of clustering so far, PCA and K-means. 
Evaluation Plan
We will evaluate based on the clusters we create using PCA and K-means.
